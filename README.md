# Slew Limiter
*IMPORTANT NOTE:*

An updated board is coming shortly, please do not order this board until I have an update out. It's been brought to my attention that my version 1.0 boards may be a bit on the long side. I tested it out on one of my cases and it mounted no problem, but on my other case it was just a touch too long to clear the rails. There are no traces below the outputs ground leg so you can carefully trim a little bit off there if you already have the board, but if not please wait for a revision to be posted to save yourself some trouble.

*Build Notes* 

* This module in its current state is untested, though an earlier revision worked as expected. I rearranged the board layout to make the build a little bit easier and am now awaiting the board and front panel to arrive so I can build and test it. On the previous revision my board and front panel did not line up correctly and I can't verify this as being fixed until my order arrives, so please do not order the front panel as is without checking the work for yourself or seeing here that it is verified.
* The included Gerber files have been generated for JLCPCB
* JLCPCB does not detect the pcb size for the front panel. You can enter it as 128x20mm


This module is a simple slew limiter with a very low parts count that is quick and easy to build. There are no extra frills, just a pot for slew amount, a toggle switch to select between slewing up, down, or both, one input, and one output. 

I drew the schematic from a stripboard layout done by user Mcshafty on the Look Mum No Computer discourse forums ([link here](https://lookmumnocomputer.discourse.group/t/slew-generator-stripboard-confirmed-working/1865)), which is based off of schematics from [Dintree](https://dintree.com) and [YuSynth](https://yusynth.com).
